Rabbit MQ is used as messaging middle ware.


The agenda of this lab is to demonstrate distributed computing using RabbitMQ to distribute messages to different services. 
RabbitMQ is a messaging broker - an intermediary for messaging. 
It provides a common platform to asynchronously send and receive messages.
The messages after published by the sender will be stored in the queue until the receiver subscribes those messages. 
We created a Facebook Application that has functionalities like login, sign up, search, send and accept friend requests,
creating and deleting groups, creating and deleting members from group. We used Mongo DB to store all the details.
